## Running this application
First, install the Streamlit framework: 
`pip install streamlit`

Second, run one of the following commands:
+ For the version on this repo: `streamlit run https://github.com/billboardcat/sos9/blob/master/app.py`
+ For a local version: `streamlit run /PATH/TO/app.py`

Third, if Streamlit does not automatically open your browser, navigate to `localhost`

Finally, to refresh the app view after a change in code, simply refresh the page.
